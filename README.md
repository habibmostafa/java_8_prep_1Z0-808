This repo is for me, primarily, but feel free to fork it:
- It will just contain code developed as solutions I have written or am trying to understand for this course as I go through the course and prehaps re-do it in the future.
- I may tweak it a little bit every now and then to allow myself to start from scratch (as practice) locally.
- I will try my best to make problems more interesting or who knows maybe I will find better more interesting solutions through this practice.
